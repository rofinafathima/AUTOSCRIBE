# Login Issue Fixed ✅

## Problem
After logging in as a student, the page was not redirecting to the student dashboard properly.

## Root Cause
The login script (`script.js`) was storing user data with the key `type: 'student'`, but the student dashboard (`student-script.js`) was checking for `role: 'student'`. This mismatch caused the authentication check to fail.

## Solution Applied

### Updated `script.js`:
1. **Fixed `storeUserData()` function** to store user data with the correct format:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('currentUser', JSON.stringify({
       id: userData.id,
       name: userData.name,
       email: userData.email,
       role: userData.type,  // ✅ Changed from 'type' to 'role'
       class: userData.class || '',
       language: userData.language || 'en'
   }));
   ```

2. **Added language preference storage**:
   - Automatically saves selected language to `localStorage`
   - Language persists across sessions

3. **Dual storage for compatibility**:
   - Stores with both `autoscribe_user` and `currentUser` keys
   - Ensures compatibility with all dashboard scripts

## How to Test

## Troubleshooting

   localStorage.clear();
   location.reload();
   ```

2. **Check browser console for errors**:
   - Press F12 to open developer tools
   - Look for any red error messages
   - Check if demo-data.js is loaded

3. **Verify files are in correct location**:
   - All HTML files should be in the same folder
   - All JS files should be in the same folder
   - Check file names match exactly

4. **Test with different browser**:
   - Try Chrome (recommended)
   - Try Edge
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled

## Files Modified

- ✅ `script.js` - Fixed user data storage format
- ✅ All other files remain unchanged
